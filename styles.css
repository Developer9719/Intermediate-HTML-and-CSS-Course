/* Positioning */
/*
Absolute Positioning
- position: absolute; is used to position an element relative to its nearest positioned ancestor

- The element is removed from the normal document flow
- top, right, bottom, and left properties are used to specify the position
- these elements don't effect the layout of other elements and don't get effected by other elements
Sticky Positioning
- position: sticky; is used to position an element based on the user's scroll position
- The element is treated as relative until it crosses a specified threshold, then it is treated as fixed
- top, right, bottom, and left properties are used to specify the position
- these elements don't effect the layout of other elements and don't get effected by other elements
Relative
- position: relative; is used to position an element relative to its normal position

/* CSS Functions */
/*
Functions
- IE: rgba();
- any value in CSS with a () beside it
- calc()
    - calc() is a CSS function that allows you to perform calculations to determine CSS property values.
    - It can be used to calculate lengths, percentages, and other values.
    - Example: width: calc(100% - 50px);
- min()
    - min() is a CSS function that allows you to set a minimum value for a CSS property.
    - It can be used to ensure that a property value does not go below a certain threshold.
    - Example: width: min(100%, 50px);
        - This will set the width to 50px if 100% of the parent element's width is greater than 50px.
- max()
    - max() is a CSS function that allows you to set a maximum value for a CSS property.
    - It can be used to ensure that a property value does not go above a certain threshold.
    - Example: width: max(100%, 50px);
        - This will set the width to 100% of the parent element's width if it is less than 50px.
- clamp()
    - clamp() is a CSS function that allows you to set a value that can grow and shrink between a defined minimum and maximum.
    - It can be used to create responsive designs that adapt to different screen sizes.
    - Example: width: clamp(300px, 50%, 800px);
        - This will set the width to 50% of the parent element's width, but not less than 300px or more than 800px.

/* Custom Properties */
/*
Custom Properties 
- aka CSS variables
- work the same as any other programming language variable
- accepts 2 parameters the custom property name and a fallback value
- can be defined using the --custom-property-name syntax
- can be reused throughout the stylesheet
- can be dynamically changed with JavaScript
- can be accessed using the var() function
    - IE: var(--custom-property-name)
- Fallback value
    - property that is used if the custom property is invalid
- Scope
    - declared by the selector
    - can be global or local
    - global variables are available throughout the entire stylesheet and are declared in :root{} which is the same as targeting the html itself
    - local variables are only available within the selector they are declared in

/* Frameworks and Preprocessors */
/*
- Framework CSS
    - Bootstrap CSS is a type of framework CSS

/* Form Validation */
/*
Styling Form Validations
- target passed and failed styles can be applied using CSS with the :valid and :invalid pseudo-classes
*/

/* CSS Grid */
/* 
Grid Container 
- display: grid;: Container stretches to take up space
- display: inline-grid;: Container only takes up as much space as its content
- Parent element is marked with the class of container and all its child elements
automatically become grid items.
- Grid items are only direct children of the grid container not children of children
- Grid items can also be grid containers though
- Grid track is the space between grid items
    - grid-template-columns
    - grid-template-rows
    - grid-template: 50px 50px 50px / 50px 50px;
        - This will create a grid with 3 rows and 2 columns.
Explicit vs Implicit Grid
- If you add a 5th item to a 2x2 grid it creates a 3rd row automatically (implicit)
- If you define a grid with specific rows and columns (explicit)
- Explicit properties are not carried over into implicit grid items.
    - You can set the properties for these using grid-auto, grid-auto-rows, and grid-auto-columns
Gap
- AKA gutter or alley
- column-gap
Lines
- Grid lines are created implicitly after grid tracks (space between grid items)
are defined
    - Numbered left to right and top to bottom 
    - A 3x3 grid has vertical lines numbered from 1 to 4 (columns) and
    horizontal lines numbered from 1 to 4 (rows)
Positioning 
- grid-column-start: Defines the starting position (grid line) of a grid item within a grid column.
- grid-column-end: Defines the ending position (grid line) of a grid item within a grid column.
- grid-row-start: Defines the starting position (grid line) of a grid item within a grid row.
- grid-row-end: Defines the ending position (grid line) of a grid item within a grid row.

  as a grid property
  - clamp(): Sets a value between a defined minimum and maximum or ideal value. The
  ideal value is the preferred size of the grid item and is a dynamics measurement
  whereas the minimum and maximum values are static measurements.
